<p>This cssSlider template will present your images with an elegant edge as each slide does a graceful spiral fade in and out.  Thanks to this dynamic entry and exit, this is one slider which will work beautifully on any site that hosts photos or illustrations with vibrant colors and a strong focal point.  Visitors to your website will also enjoy consistent control of the slideshow all the way through, making your home page a place that they will undoubtedly want to return to again and again.
</p>

<p>The navigation is easy to spot and manage, with delicate white arrows on either side of the slidedeck in order to move ahead or to see past images.  Viewers can stop the show at any point and take it back to the first slide by tapping anywhere on the image and whenever they’re ready to resume, they can proceed by using the white forward arrow on the right side of the screen.  Meanwhile, the unobtrusive preview panel at the bottom of the slidedeck will show any of the slides in the show when users hover their mouse over the individual boxes.  If you’re wondering where you are in the show, the box that represents the current slide will appear in a bolder white line than the rest to eliminate any confusion.  Click on the box that’s linked to the image you want to see and the slideshow will take you to that image right away.  
</p>

<p>
There’s a transparent title box outlined in white in the upper right-hand corner of the images, and a new one slides in from the left with every change of scene.  It uses a graceful, white script that is both easy to read and timeless enough to complement a wide range of site designs.  As the slide exits the screen, the title box slides back to the left and the wording fades out, creating a more seamless transition to the next image and the new title box.  
</p>

<p>With this pure CSS3-created slideshow, your photographs and drawings can easily be viewed on any modern mobile device without any hassle at all.  In fact, you can reliably expect the same incredible performance that you’ve come to love in all cssSlider templates, even without the use of jQuery or JavaScript.  Choose this template now and see how easy it is to build the perfect slideshow for your website in no time at all.
